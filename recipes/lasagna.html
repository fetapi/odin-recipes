    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,made in very wide, flat sheets. In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>

    <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>

 </ul>
    <h1>Preparation</h1>
     <ol>
         <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
         <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and onion over medium heat. Drain excess fat.</li>
         <li>Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
         <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, sugar, and wine/water.</li>
         <li>Simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
         <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta, egg, Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
         <li>Spread 1 cup meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
         <li>Layer 3-4 lasagna noodles (uncooked or oven-ready).</li>
         <li>Spread ⅓ of the ricotta mixture, then 1 cup meat sauce, and 1 cup mozzarella.</li>
         <li>Repeat layers twice more (noodles → ricotta → sauce → mozzarella).</li>
         <li>Top with the last noodles, remaining meat sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan.</li>
         <li>Cover with foil (sprayed with oil to prevent sticking).</li>
         <li>Bake for 25 minutes, then remove foil and bake 15-20 more minutes until bubbly and golden.</li>
         <li>Let rest 10-15 minutes before slicing.</li>
     </ol>
